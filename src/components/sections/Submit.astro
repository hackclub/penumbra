  <h1>submit.</h1>
  <p>Before you submit - make sure you:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>joined our Slack</li>
    <li>measured your coding time with Hackatime</li>
    <li>have your shader published on ShaderToy AND a Git repository</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="no-anim">
    You'll need to work <em>at least 4 hours</em> on your shader for it to qualify to get a free poster.
  </p>

  <p class="no-anim">
    If you work on a shader for <em>more</em> than 4 hours, the extra time is counted towards a <em>GPU</em>.
    You can choose to opt out of a poster in order to get all of your hours counted towards this goal -
    but then you won't get a really cool poster...
